* I changed from source

AMBIGUOUS SOURCE, OR I CHANGED FROM SOURCE but may not have [Editorial] in git
---------------------

Chapter 5
    * Page 47: Source scan is unclear, but I believe there is the comma as I
        put it in:
        "streaming into my bedroom through the open window, woke me"
    * Page 60: "onto a good thing" in source
        I corrected to "on to a good thing" 

Chapter 7
    * Page 73 "unbiassed" - changed to "unbiased"

Chapter 8
    * Page 83: Changed comma to period at end of:
        "We was talking there, ma'am, when Bob, what had followed me unknown,
        trotted in."

Chapter 10
    * Page 106: changed: "Not really a Coward" to "Not Really a Coward"
    * Page 109: "Net and Mackerel" was quoted in source, but not quoting here

Chapter 11
    * Page 114: "decided against such a course" - source has "such a source"
        but this makes no sense, so I'm keeping it corrected as gutenberg had
        it
    * Page 120: "Why do I miss these goods things?" in source
        corrected to "good things?"

Chapter 12
    * Page 130:
        revamped quotes and mdashes on "I have just got <i>The Outsider</i>"

Chapter 14
    * Page 144 changed "desolute" to "desolate" because I can't find the word
        "desolute"

Chapter 16
    * Page 171: "I punched Tom Leigh" doesn't start new paragraph in source,
        but I changed it because it starts new double-quote and seems to
        need to.
    * Page 173: hard to tell but I believe
        "and Harrod's jumpy, or that the bearings" actually does have a
        comma in the source

Chapter 20
    * Page 216: "not be drear and blank; that a more judicious"
        is colon in source, but doesn't make sense so I changed it to semicolon
    * Page 221: "Me dear boy,--" in source mdash is outside of quotes, but I
        corrected it.

Chapter 22
    * Page 240: "Great Scott", in source it is "Great Scot"
        (in chapter 13 source has correctly "Great Scott")

Chapter 23
    * Page 249: changed : to ;
        "She mentioned the figure that would clear us; I patted the dog."
