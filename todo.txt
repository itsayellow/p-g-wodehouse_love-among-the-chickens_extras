I KEPT EBOOK LIKE SOURCE, BUT MAY BE WRONG
------------------------------------------

Dedication:

Chapter 1
    + Page 11: "sketching tour in the west."  Shouldn't west be capitalized?
    + Page 13: modernize "summer time" as "summertime" ?

Chapter 2

Chapter 3
    + Page 29: "either blue nor grey" change to either blue or grey?
    + Page 29: should "without interest in life, and one or two other" be
        "without interest in life; and one or two other"
        because each category is in the sentence is separated by a semicolon?

Chapter 4

Chapter 5
    + Page 48: "turned on to the beach," should be "turned onto the beach"?

Chapter 6
    + Page 61: "wrong-headedness" should be "wrongheadedness" ?

Chapter 7

Chapter 8

Chapter 9
    + Page 89: "our cold-dinner party a shopwoman," should be
        "out cold-dinner party, a shopwoman," ?
    + Page 91: in Cambridge dictionary, "light-hearted" is "English" while
        "lighthearted" is "American".  Does that mean in an en_GB text the
        word should be "light-heartedness" as in original?

Chapter 10

Chapter 11

Chapter 12
    + Page 129: "the <i>Manoeuvres of Arthur</i>" should be
        "<i>The Manoeuvres of Arthur</i>" ?  Maybe not, maybe is a breezy
        way of referring to the book.
    + Page 130: "the <i>Manoeuvres of Arthur</i>" should be
        "<i>The Manoeuvres of Arthur</i>" ?  Maybe not, maybe is a breezy
        way of referring to the book.

Chapter 13

Chapter 14

Chapter 15

Chapter 16
    + Page 171: "I don't want to see yeou again!'" - is "yeou" dialect? or
        just a typo in original?

Chapter 17

Chapter 18
    + Page 193: Ukridge says "damme" as in source...another form of "damn"?
    + Page 194: Ukridge says "damme"
    + Page 199: "miss-in-baulk" modern usage has no hyphens, but here Ukridge
        uses it as a concept, so hyphenating it may be ok?

Chapter 23


I CHANGED FROM SOURCE
---------------------

Dedication:

Chapter 1

Chapter 2

Chapter 3

Chapter 4

Chapter 5
    * Page 47: Source scan is unclear, but I believe there is the comma as I
        put it in:
        "streaming into my bedroom through the open window, woke me"
    * Page 60: "onto a good thing" in source
        I corrected to "on to a good thing" 

Chapter 6

Chapter 7
    * Page 73 "unbiassed" - changed to "unbiased"

Chapter 8
    * Page 83: Changed comma to period at end of:
        "We was talking there, ma'am, when Bob, what had followed me unknown,
        trotted in."

Chapter 9

Chapter 10
    * Page 106: changed: "Not really a Coward" to "Not Really a Coward"
    * Page 109: "Net and Mackerel" was quoted in source, but not quoting here

Chapter 11
    * Page 114: "decided against such a course" - source has "such a source"
        but this makes no sense, so I'm keeping it corrected as gutenberg had
        it
    * Page 120: "Why do I miss these goods things?" in source
        corrected to "good things?"

Chapter 12
    * Page 130:
        revamped quotes and mdashes on "I have just got <i>The Outsider</i>"

Chapter 13

Chapter 14
    * Page 144 changed "desolute" to "desolate" because I can't find the word
        "desolute"

Chapter 15

Chapter 16
    * Page 171: "I punched Tom Leigh" doesn't start new paragraph in source,
        but I changed it because it starts new double-quote and seems to
        need to.
    * Page 173: hard to tell but I believe
        "and Harrod's jumpy, or that the bearings" actually does have a
        comma in the source

Chapter 17

Chapter 18

Chapter 19

Chapter 20
    * Page 216: "not be drear and blank; that a more judicious"
        is colon in source, but doesn't make sense so I changed it to semicolon
    * Page 221: "Me dear boy,--" in source mdash is outside of quotes, but I
        corrected it.

Chapter 21

Chapter 22
    * Page 240: "Great Scott", in source it is "Great Scot"
        (in chapter 13 source has correctly "Great Scott")

Chapter 23
    * Page 249: changed : to ;
        "She mentioned the figure that would clear us; I patted the dog."


NOTES (NOTHING TO BE DONE, JUST NOTING)
---------------------------------------

Chapter 8
    + Page 86: using "appal" with one "l" because of British spelling

Chapter 11
    + Page 117: "Why, yes, Mr. Ukridge, I think I will." starts a new paragraph
        in source but gutenberg keeps it in the previous para because same
        speaker I put it back to source to show the same speaker has spoken a
        new paragraph
